  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <ul>
      <li><b>COVID-19</b></li>
      <p>COVID-19, or coronavirus, is a pandemic that has spread rapidly across the globe since it was discovered in China in December 2019. The virus is very contagious and spreads easily through air, especially in indoor spaces. As of January 16,
        there have been almost 100 million cases worldwide. For more information, visit https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html</p>
      <br>
      <li><b>Case Rate</b></li>
      <p>In our charts, we define Case Rate as the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in that age group. For example, a case rate of 5,000 for ages 18-24 would mean that out of every 100,000 18-24 year olds, there have been 5,000 confirmed
        cases. The actual number of cases is certainly higher than the confirmed cases – for example, only one member of a family may need to test positive for the rest of the family to know they have the virus. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Hospitalizations and Hospitalization Rate</b></li>
      <p>Hospitalization indicates when a patient is admitted to the hospital due to complications from the virus. In our charts, we define Hospitalization Rate as the number of hospitalizations per 100,000 people in that age group. Unlike with case
        rate, the hospitalization rate is likely an accurate estimate of the actual number of hospitalizations. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Death Rate</b></li>
      <p>In our charts, we define Death Rate as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in that age group. Tracking the number of deaths from the pandemic has faced limited scrutiny over the means of defining a death caused by COVID-19, as opposed to
        a number of other factors or pre-existing conditions. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Age groups</b></li>
      <p>In our charts, we've broken up ages into 10 groups, each with their own page. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Vulnerable populations</b></li>
      <p>Vulnerable populations are groups that are disproprotionately susceptible to harm from the virus. These groups include, but are not limited to, older people, people with pre-existing conditions, healthcare and frontlike workers, and people
        with weak immune systems. </p>
      <br>

    </ul>

    <h4>Design Principles and Heuristics: Structure, Consistency, Understandability, Political Intent </h4>
    <br> <br>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p><b>Political Intent: </b> All four sketches, and our project as a whole, share this design principle. While COVID-19 data on age groups may not seem political, too often younger people dismiss the risk of the virus since they are less
      vulnerable. Data sets like these, which clearly show that case and death rates are much higher for older populations, would aim to make a statement on public health, and (unfortunately), politics — wear a mask, don't party, keep social
      distance, and don't call the pandemic a hoax. </p>

      <h5>Neil's macropage</h5>
      <br>
      <p><b>Structure:</b> Neil's macropage sketch includes a bar graph where each age group's case, hospitalization, and death data would be grouped together as one triple-bar entity.</p>
      <p><b>Consistency and Understandability:</b> The overall layout of the page, and specifically the triple-bar graph, is consistent with the design of the micropages, allowing for easier understandability. The data shown by the graph also clearly
        would show trends when comparing higher and lower bar graphs, allowing the user to draw conclusions easily (for example, seeing death rates increase as age increases)</p>
      <p><b>Elements of Wireframe:</b> From Neil's macropage design, the main element we chose to incorporate was his triple-bar graph design. This allows us to combine the data for each age group in a more comprehensible manner. Incorporating
        separate colors and a legend for easier readability are also components we'll keep for our macropage design. </p>

      <p><b>Consistency and Understandability:</b> The overall layout of the page, and specifically the triple-bar graph, is consistent with the design of the macropage, allowing for easier understandability. Just like the macropage, the graph also
        clearly would be able to show trends, allowing the user to draw conclusions easily</p>

    <p>The following description simultaneously describes all steps of the project pipeline, while also indicating whether Neil or Michael did it.
    <p>Our project pipeline starts in either of two places: finding and processing the data, and creating and formatting the EJS-to-HTML page templates.</p>
    <p>Neil found the source for our project's data and added the CSV into the project folder. Michael then processed and cleaned the data, deciding that case, hospitalization, and death rates for the ten age groups were the only data the group needed, and discarded everything else. </p>
    <p>Michael developed the header, footer, and navbar EJS templates, largely drawing from his own previous project, an Avatar interest page. Neil and Michael agreed to draw heavily from Neil's sketch designs for both the macro and micropages – especially the triple-bar graph visual. </p>

    <p>The next step was adding text content to our macro, micro, and about pages. Neil added the text-based summaries and data comparisons for the micropages, while Michael added the important vocab, analysis of prototype sketches and wireframe elements, and project pipeline. Finally, the macropage borrowed from both Neil and Michael's design. </p>

    <p>In the final step, Neil and Michael worked together on inserting our JSON data into the c3.js bar chart templates while implementing Neil's triple-bar visual.</p>
