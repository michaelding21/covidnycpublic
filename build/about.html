    <h4>Important Vocab</h4>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <ul>
      <li><b>COVID-19</b></li>
      <p>COVID-19, or coronavirus, is a pandemic that has spread rapidly across the globe since it was discovered in China in December 2019. The virus is very contagious and spreads easily through air, especially in indoor spaces. As of January 16,
        there have been almost 100 million cases worldwide. For more information, please visit <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html">this link</a>.</p>
      <br>
      <li><b>Case Rate</b></li>
      <p>In our charts, we define Case Rate as the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 people in that age group. For example, a case rate of 5,000 for ages 18-24 would mean that out of every 100,000 18-24 year olds, there have been 5,000 confirmed
        cases. The actual number of cases is certainly higher than the confirmed cases – for example, only one member of a family may take a test to confirm they are positive with the virus, even though the entire family likely is positive. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Hospitalizations and Hospitalization Rate</b></li>
      <p>Hospitalization indicates when a patient is admitted to the hospital due to complications from the virus. In our charts, we define Hospitalization Rate as the number of hospitalizations per 100,000 people in that age group. Unlike with case
        rate, the hospitalization rate is a very accurate estimate of the actual number of hospitalizations. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Death Rate</b></li>
      <p>In our charts, we define Death Rate as the number of deaths per 100,000 people in that age group. Tracking the number of deaths from the pandemic has faced some controversy over the means of defining a death caused by COVID-19, as opposed to
        a death caused by a number of other factors, like pre-existing conditions. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Age groups</b></li>
      <p>For our project, we've broken up ages into 10 groups, each with their own micropage. </p>
      <br>

      <li><b>Vulnerable populations</b></li>
      <p>Vulnerable populations are groups that are disproprotionately susceptible to getting the virus or being severely impacted by it. These groups include, but are not limited to, older people, people with pre-existing conditions, healthcare and frontlike workers, and people
        with weak immune systems. </p>
      <br>

    <h4>Design Principles and Heuristics: Structure, Consistency, Understandability, Political Intent </h4>
    <br> <br>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <p><b>Political Intent: </b> All four sketches, and our project as a whole, share this design principle. While COVID-19 data on age groups may not seem political, too often younger people have dismissed the risk of the virus since they are less
      vulnerable. We've seen this in our own lives and in the public eye, with people partying, going to crowded beaches, and walking around without masks. Data sets like these, which clearly show that cases and death rates are much higher for older populations, would aim to make a statement on public health, and unfortunately, politics — wear a mask, don't party, keep social
      distancing, don't spread misinformation about the pandemic, and prioritize pandemic relief. </p>

      <h5>Michael's macropage</h5>
      <br>
      <p><b>Structure:</b> Michael's macropage sketch has a structure that is difficult to understand. It would be unclear how the map of COVID-19 outbreaks and the line chart would correspond. While the data they use may be very similar, the structure causes unnecessary confusion for the user, and could be much more simple .</p>
      <p><b>Consistency and Understandability:</b> The overall layout of the page is poor. There is too much unnecessary information, such as splitting data up by borough, which isn't really relevant to our message about the virus' disproportionate impact on certain age groups. The design is also completely inconsistent with that of the micropages.</p>
      <p><b>Elements of Wireframe:</b> The main element that we chose to incorporate into our actual macropage was the section that lists the overall macro averages for cases, hospitalizations, and death rates. In the sketch it says data by borough, but once we changed that, the idea of having those averages front-and-center on the page provided a simple reference point for our other data.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="col">
      <h5>Michael's macropage</h5>
      <br>
      <p><b>Structure:</b> Michael's micropage sketch has a neat, organized structure that is easy to follow – first look at the graph for a visual understanding of data on this specific age group, then read the summary for a clearer explanation of what to take away, and then, finally, a comparison to the macro averages for an added sense of perspective.</p>
      <p><b>Consistency and Understandability:</b> Each micropage design features a consistent graph-summary-comparison structure. As noted in the analysis above, the data is presented in an easy way to understand. </p>
      <p><b>Elements of Wireframe:</b> The main elements that we chose to incorporate from Michael's micropage design was the page layout, where we presented the graph first, then the summary, and then the comparison. This structure worked well to not only fit project requirements, but also guide the user on a clear path of understanding — first intuitive and visual, then a clearer textual summary, and finally a clear-cut, quantitative comparison to the overall averages.    </p>

    <div class="col">
      <h5>Neil's macropage</h5>
      <br>
      <p><b>Structure:</b> Neil's macropage sketch includes a bar graph where each age group's case, hospitalization, and death data would be grouped together as one triple-bar entity. This effectively groups up information on each age group, which is a logical structure to have. </p>
      <p><b>Consistency and Understandability:</b> The overall layout of the page, and specifically the triple-bar graph, is consistent with the design of the micropages, allowing for easier understandability. The data shown by the graph also clearly
        would show trends when comparing higher and lower bar graphs, allowing the user to draw conclusions easily (for example, seeing death rates increase as age increases).</p>
      <p><b>Elements of Wireframe:</b> From Neil's macropage design, the main element we chose to incorporate was his triple-bar graph design. This allows us to combine the data for each age group in a more comprehensible manner. Incorporating
        separate colors and a legend for easier readability are also components we'll keep for our macropage design. </p>

    <div class="col">
      <h5>Neil's micropage</h5>
      <br>
      <p><b>Structure:</b> Neil's micropage sketch also includes a triple-bar graph, combining each age group's cases, hospitalization, and death data into a "triple bar," which is logical and more easy to understand.</p>
      <p><b>Consistency and Understandability:</b> The overall layout of the page, specifically the triple-bar graph, is consistent with the design of the macropage, allowing for easier understandability. Just like the macropage, the graph also
        clearly would be able to show trends, allowing the user to draw conclusions easily</p>
      <p><b>Elements of Wireframe:</b> From Neil's micropage design, the main element we chose to incorporate was his double-bar graph design, which, combined with his macropage triple-bar design, led to us using a triple-bar design for all of our charts. This allows us to combine the data for each age group in a more comprehensible manner.</p>

    <h5>Pipeline Contributions</h5>
    <p>The following description simultaneously describes all steps of the project pipeline, while also indicating whether Neil or Michael did it.
    <p>Our project pipeline starts in either of two places: finding and processing the data, or creating and formatting the EJS-to-HTML page templates.</p>
    <p>Neil found the source for our project's data and added the CSV into the project folder. Michael then processed and cleaned the data, deciding that case, hospitalization, and death rates for the ten age groups were the only data the group needed, and discarded everything else. </p>
    <p>Michael developed the header, footer, and navbar EJS templates, largely drawing from his own previous project, an Avatar interest page. Neil and Michael agreed to draw heavily from Neil's sketch designs for both the macro and micropages – especially the triple-bar graph visual. </p>

    <p>The next step was adding text content to our macro, micro, and about pages. Neil added the text-based summaries and data comparisons for the micropages, while Michael added the important vocab, analysis of prototype sketches and wireframe elements, and project pipeline. Michael and Neil worked together on compiling the final page designs, both the template and the actual content. </p>

    <p>In the final step, Neil and Michael worked together on inserting our JSON data into the c3.js bar chart templates while implementing Neil's triple-bar visual.</p>
    <h5>Non-Pipeline Contributions</h5>
    <p>Michael and Neil worked together to develop the build pipeline in package.json. Michael handled precompiling, and Neil and Michael worked together to build the templates necessary for compiling, as well as determining which data tests to use.</p>
